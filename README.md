# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Trend Analysis using Python

This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Zomato Bangalore restaurant dataset. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns in customer ratings, votes, restaurant types, cost distribution, and online ordering trends using Python libraries.

---

## 📝 Description

The project uses the Zomato dataset to analyze key business aspects such as:
- Popular restaurant types
- Distribution of customer ratings
- Online order trends and their correlation with ratings
- Voting patterns and most popular restaurants
- Approximate cost analysis for two people
- Visualizing category relationships using heatmaps and pivot tables

The analysis is performed using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,** and **Seaborn** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Import the Zomato dataset and perform initial inspection.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Remove unnecessary characters (like `/5` in ratings)  
   - Convert data types for analysis  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Count plots for restaurant types and online orders  
   - Grouped analysis of votes per restaurant type  
   - Distribution plots for ratings and cost  
   - Boxplots comparing online vs offline order ratings  
   - Heatmaps showing relationships between features  

4. **Insights Extraction**  
   Identify the most popular restaurant categories, rating trends, and customer preferences.
